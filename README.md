This repository contains my program modifications and exercises from "Assembly
Language Step By Step". Specifically:
* A fixed version of `hexdump2`
* Exercise from chapter 11 that prints environment contents - `showenvs`
* Exercise from chapter 12 that appends line numbers in input file and outputs
  the modified file to stdout and provided output file - `lineno`
